First of All We Need to Create a Relational Hierarchy
between the roles

Here are some questions I have  : 
What is the  usp of the app ? Is it the one stop solution for all TM related operations. We might want to list down the feature of the app.

Do we want all the clubs to use the app in order to avail its full functionality. In that case,TMI has to brand the application. It will better if we put a mail to them proposing the idea.

Does the app behave differntly for all the roles mentioned above? if yes, programming wise does it require separate efforts for each role?
